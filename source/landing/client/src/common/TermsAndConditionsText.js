              view and transmit information about public cryptographic keys.
              Change has a right to unilaterally decide and change the
              cryptocurrencies which can be stored in the Wallet using the
              Wallet Service or converted using the Conversion Service.
            </li>
            <li>
              Upon using the Wallet Service each User is obliged to fully adhere
              to the terms and conditions of the Custodian, in addition to
              adhering to these Terms.
            </li>
            <li>
              Change is not a custodian of any cryptocurrency and/or tokens
              (including the Tokens) transferred to or held in the Wallet. All
              cryptocurrencies and tokens (including the Tokens) are held by the
              Custodian. Change reserves the right to change the Custodian at
              any time, without prior notification or justification thereto. To
              the maximum extent permissible under applicable legal acts, Change
              assumes no liability for any possible damages caused by the
              Custodian.
            </li>
            <li>
              Upon the creation of the Account, the Wallet is automatically
              created for each User, together with a public key which serves as
              the address of the Wallet. Change has the sole right to decide
              whether or not to disclose that public key to the User. Change may
              (but is not obliged to) disclose the public keys only to some
              Users chosen (at the full discretion of Change) and may at any
              time and without any prior notice to the Users stop or commence
              disclosing the public keys to the Users.
            </li>
            <li>
              To transmit information concerning the Account to the relevant
              cryptocurrency network (i.e. to carry out a transaction with
              cryptocurrency), two private keys (out of three private keys in
              total) are required. One of such private keys is held by Change,
              the other by the Custodian and the third is held by a third-party
              backup service provider.
            </li>
            <li>
              The User shall be solely responsible for the safekeeping of the
              third private key. If the User appoints a third party to control
              its private key, whether or not such appointment is made through
              the Website or the Apps, Change will not be responsible for the
              actions or omissions of such third party.
            </li>
            <li>
              Change does not own or control the underlying software protocols
              which govern the operation of cryptocurrencies held in the Wallet.
              Such protocols are subject to changes in protocol rules, which are
              outside the control of Change and may materially affect the value,
              function, or name of the relevant cryptocurrency. Each user
              acknowledges and agrees that:
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Change is not responsible for operation of the underlying
                  cryptocurrency protocols and that Change makes no guarantee of
                  their functionality, security, or availability; and
                </li>
                <li>
                  if a change in the software protocol related to the
                  cryptocurrency occurs, Change may suspend the Wallet Service,
                  and Change may decide not to provide Wallet Service for the
                  cryptocurrency being affected or may configure the Wallet
                  Service to enable the User to transfer the affected
                  cryptocurrency.

              Change provides to certain eligible Users (depending on their
              domicile and other factors, determined at the sole discretion of
              Change) the Conversion Service, by which eligible Users may buy

              cryptocurrencies.

            <li>
              Change makes the transactions described in Section 7.1 above on
              the basis of irrevocable instructions from the User eligible for
              Conversion Service, which can be submitted by such Users through
              the Apps or Website.

              an instruction submitted in accordance with Section 7.2 above. If,
              after the submission of an instruction in accordance with Section
              7.2 above by an eligible User, Change determines that it is
              unwilling to carry out the transactions requested by the eligible
              User in its instructions, Change may decline to carry out the
              transaction by notifying the User thereof on the Website and in
              the Apps, and shall assume no liability for any damages which
              arise to the eligible User as a result thereof.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Website and Apps will display to Users for all supported
              cryptocurrencies the estimated Conversion Rate or exact Conversion
              Rate for transaction marked as complete. The estimated Conversion
              Rate will also be brought out in the instructions submitted in
              accordance with Section 7.2 above and upon submitting to Change an
              instruction in accordance with Section 7.2 above, the eligible
              User must irrevocably confirm its request to carry out the
              transaction without certainty of Conversion Rate.
            </li>
            <li>
              After receiving from an eligible User instructions in accordance
              with Section 7.2 above, Change will complete the transaction
              requested by the eligible User in its instructions within 5
              business days after receiving the payment (whereas a business day
              is considered to be a day when banks are generally open for
              business in Estonia), unless Change declines to carry out the
              transaction and notifies the User in accordance with Section 7.3
              above. Change reserves the right to delay any Conversion Service
              transaction if it perceives a risk of fraud or illegal activity.

            <li>
              In case the eligible User requests in its instructions submitted
              in accordance with Section 7.2 above to buy from Change a
              supported cryptocurrency in exchange for a specified Fiat
              currency, the User must within 15 business days transfer to the
              bank account of Change (using the payment instructions displayed
              to the User in the Apps or Website) the amount of specified Fiat
              currency required for the transaction, as shown to the User in the
              Apps or Website. In case the eligible User requests in its
              instructions submitted in accordance with Section 7.2 above to buy

              the requested supported cryptocurrency will be automatically
              debited from the User’s Wallet. In case the eligible User requests
              in its instructions submitted in accordance with Section 7.2 above
              to sell to Change a supported cryptocurrency in exchange for a

              requested by the User by notifying the User thereof on the Website

              In case the eligible User has in its instructions submitted a

              completion of the relevant transaction be transferred to the
              User’s Wallet. In case the eligible User has in its instructions
              submitted a request to sell to Change a supported cryptocurrency
              in exchange for a specified Fiat currency, the amount of specified
              Fiat currency will be transferred after the completion of the
              relevant transaction to the User’s account specified in the User’s
              instruction, issued in accordance with Section 7.2 above.

              Change is liable for and shall be obliged to compensate to Users
              only direct monetary damages (and for the avoidance of doubt, no
              indirect damages or loss of profits) and only on the condition
              that such damages are caused to the User by Change either
              intentionally or due to gross negligence.
            </li>
            <li>
              The liability of Change is reduced by the amount equal to the
              damages which the User could have avoided by taking reasonable
              efforts.

              In addition to the limitations described elsewhere in these Terms,

              Change assumes no liability for any damages caused by third
              parties (including but not limited to the Custodian) or by

              limited to volatility of cryptocurrencies).

              Change is processing Users’ personal data for the performance of
              or entering into a contract, in the form of the Terms, concluded
              or to be concluded with the Users. Each User’s personal data is
              processed for the purposes of providing the Services to the User.
              Without processing the User’s personal data, Change would be
              unable to provide Services to the User.

              For complying with our legal obligations deriving from applicable
              legislation, as specified in Section 8 above and for meeting our
              accounting/financial obligations, we are also processing Users’
              personal data on the basis of legislation. For complying with our
              legal obligations, as specified in Section 8 above, Change may
              receive data from other sources than the User, e.g. from public
              and non-public sources.
            </li>
            <li>
              The personal data of Users is being processed by the following
              categories of data recipients: Change’s employees responsible for
              specific tasks regarding the Services, data processors who help
              Change with providing the Services (e.g. service providers for the
              maintenance of our IT-systems and for fulfilling our legal
              obligations as stated in Section 8 above) and third persons to
              whom Change is required to transfer data under applicable
              legislation, e.g. relevant state institutions and sector-specific
              authorities.

            <li>
              Change has engaged a third-party service provider, Onfido Ltd, for
              obtaining certain information required in relation to the
              fulfilment of its obligations under anti-money laundering and
              terrorist financing prevention rules. While providing services to
              Change, Onfido Ltd processes your personal data as a data
              processor, however, for enhancing its machine learning
              capabilities Onfido Ltd is also processing Users’ personal data as
              a data controller. To acquaint itself with the relevant data
              processing activities which Onfido Ltd undertakes as a data
              controller the User should read and review the privacy policy

              responsibility in relation to processing activities Onfido Ltd
              undertakes as a data controller and the Users are free to exercise
              their rights as data subjects in relation to Onfido Ltd fully and
              independently.

            <li>
              Certain activities of Change may result in the transferring of
              personal data to third countries, meaning countries located
              outside the EU/EEA, and to countries in relation to which the EU
              Commission has not issued an adequacy decision, e.g. the US. For
              ensuring that the User’s data is protected, Changes applies
              appropriate safeguards in the form of standard data protection
              clauses adopted by the European Commission for the transfers. In
              case the User wishes to know more about the safeguards and obtain
              a relevant copy of them, please contact Change using the details
              specified in Section 12.2 above.

            <li>
              Change is not responsible for the actions and processing
              activities of any third parties. Third parties are considered to
              be separate data controllers, whose services can be procured by
              concluding separate agreements with them. Third parties may
              transfer Users’ personal data to third countries and process it
              for independent purposes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Users’ personal data is, generally, retained as long as the User
              is using the Services. After the User has stopped using the
              Services and the Account of the User has been closed, pursuant to
              Section 9 above, the User’s personal data shall be retained as
              long as any claims can be presented on the basis of such data
              under applicable legislation. Certain data, e.g. data necessary
              for accounting purposes, data obtained for the purposes of the
              fulfilment of obligations related to anti-money laundering and
              terrorist financing prevention, shall be retained as required
              under applicable legislation and industry standards.

            <li>
              For entering into a contract and for the performance of a contract
              between the User and Change, Change is applying certain automated
              decision-making methods to assess the User’s capability and
              suitability, among other for the purposes indicated in Section 8
              above, to enter into a contract between the User and Change.
              Change is applying the capability of human-intervention into the
              aforesaid assessment, however, in cases the User is seen as not
              suitable for entering into the contract, in the form of the Terms,
              Change reserves the right not to enter into or stop the
              performance of the contract.
